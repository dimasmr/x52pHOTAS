# x52proHOTAS
Logitech/Saitek x52 pro H.O.T.A.S. joystick interface (C++, Simulink), using DirectX API (DirectInput and Direct Output).
This requires DirectX in Windows. For Linux, see the linux branch in this repository.
Developed on the basis of the samples shown in https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/main/DirectInput/Joystick

Make sure you have installed DirectX SDK https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812. This SDK providess the necessary headers like dinput.h and libraries like dinput8.lib, dxguid.lib.

Download the DirectOutput API (.lib, .h, and .dll) https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq8Kg0iqxkdrgfxXZBc5CL-a9-SAaQ. See https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/how-to-use-x52-pro-sdk-making-us-of-the-mfd-and-leds.428813/. Put the DirectOutput.lib, DirectOutput.h, and DirectOutput.dll in your folder.

Necessary files to be in your folder (where your .slx present, or the referenced path):
  1. DirectOutput.lib, DirectOutput.h, and DirectOutput.dll (put the DirectOuput.dll in the folder where your .exe presents)
  2. x52p_ctrl.h the header file
  3. x52p_ctrl.cpp the function definition file: this file
  4. Your .cpp impelementation file (put it in Source Files)

**HOW TO COMPILE IN VISUAL STUDIO** </br> 
Include the x52p_ctrl.h in the header files (project tree) and in your folder.
When something goes wrong, you can manually set everything in the project properties.
1. In the C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories, add the "Include" folder of the DirectX SDK.
   (Find the folder in your DirectX SDK installation directory).
2. In the Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories, add the "Lib/x64" (if win64) of the
   DirectX SDK (find it in your DirectX SDK installation directory).
3. In the Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies, write DirectOutput.lib; dinput8.lib; dxguid.lib, add.

**HOW TO COMPILE (FOR MATLAB SIMULINK)**
1. You need C++ compiler available in your system. 
2. Be sure to set the compiler appropriately for C++, use "mex -setup" and choose accordingly. 
3. Compile in Matlab with "mex x52p_ctrl_SFun_wInput.cpp". 
4. This gives you a mexw64 file (Matlab executable file) in the folder, which is why the DirectOutput.dll should be in the same place with the executable file.

Open the Simulink file x52pro_HOTAS.slx and see more.
